## üéØ Objectives

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your understanding of basic JavaScript concepts such as conditional statements and loops.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Getting Started

To get started with this assignment, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine and open the folder using VS Code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
cd repository-name
code .
```

## ‚úÖ Tasks

Please **_do not edit any other file_** except those specified here.
The assignment tasks are as follows:

#### **1. FizzBuzz**

-   In the `fizzBuzz.js` file, write a JavaScript function that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100, with the following exceptions:

    -   For numbers divisible by 3 (and not 5), print "Fizz" instead of the number
    -   For numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
    -   For numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 "FizzBuzz".

-   The name of your function must be `fizzBuzz`.
-   Use `console.log()` to print the output.
-   Each number should be printed on a new line.
-   The function should have no arguments.
-   The function should `return` nothing.
-   **_Hint:_** Look up the [remainder operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Remainder).

#### **2. Looping a triangle**

-   In the `printTriangle.js` file, write a JavaScript functions that prints a right triangle of height `n`.
-   The name of your function must be `printTriangle`.
-   Use `console.log()` to print each line of the triangle on a new line.
-   Each line of the triangle consists of a string of `*` characters.
-   The function must take 1 argument corresponding to the height of the triangle: `n`.
-   The function must `return` nothing.
-   Here is an example of the expected output when `printTriangle(5)` is called:

```bash
*
**
***
****
*****
```

-   **_Hint:_** You can build the string by starting with an empty one (`""`) and repeatedly adding characters.
-   **_Hint:_** You can work on each row by making a loop that builds a string for that row. Then, use `console.log()` to print the row.

#### **3. Chessboard**

-   In the `chessboard.js` file, write a JavaScript functions that creates a string that represents a `m`x`n` grid, using newline characters to separate lines.
-   Once the string is created, the function then prints it to the console.
-   At each position of the grid there is either a space or a `#` character.
-   The characters should form a chessboard.
-   The name of your first function must be `chessboard`.
-   The functions must take two arguments corresponding to the size of the grid: `m` and `n`.
    -   `m` is the number of rows
    -   `n` is the number of columns
-   The function must `return` nothing.
-   Here is an example of the expected output when `chessboard(8, 6)` is called:

```bash
# # #
 # # #
# # #
 # # #
# # #
 # # #
# # #
 # # #
```

-   **_Hint:_** You can build the string by starting with an empty one (`""`) and repeatedly adding characters. A newline character is written `\n`.
-   **_Hint:_** You can work on each row by making a loop that builds a string for that row. Then, you can concatenate the rows together.

#### **4. Caesar Cipher**

-   In cryptography, a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of `3`, `A` would be replaced by `D`, `B` would become `E`, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
-   In the `caesarCipher.js` file, write a JavaScript functions that takes a string and an integer as arguments and prints a string with the letters shifted by the integer, preserving the case of each letter.
-   The name of your function must be `caesarCipher`.
-   Use `console.log()` to print the output.
-   The function must take 2 arguments:
    -   `str` is the string to be encrypted
    -   `shift` is the number of characters to shift
-   The function must `return` nothing.
-   Here is an example of the expected output when `caesarCipher("Hello, World!", 5)` is called:

```bash
Mjqqt, Btwqi!
```

-   **_Hint:_** Look up the [ASCII table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters) to get the decimal value of each character in the string.
-   **_Hint:_** You can use the [charCodeAt()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charCodeAt) method to get the ASCII value of a character. You can then use the [fromCharCode()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode) method to convert the ASCII value back to a character.

### üß™ Testing your code (Optional)
